# TournamentPlanner

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.
Made by Seppe Geudens

# Description

This Angular application is based on the application of tournamentsoftware.com.
The reason for this application is that tournamentsoftware.com only provides an application for Windows operating systems and not for the other systems.
So my Angular application is a web based solution that every operating system can acces the software via the internet.
